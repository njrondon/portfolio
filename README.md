### Projects
* Unified model for Structured Sentiment Analysis.
  
The Structured Sentiment Analysis project developed a model to extract detailed sentiment information from text. Rather than just determining whether the sentiment of a text is positive or negative, this project goes a step further to identify the "Source" (who is expressing the sentiment), "Target" (what the sentiment is about), "Polar_expression" (the specific words or phrases describing the sentiment), and "Polarity" (the overall sentiment value). This involves processing complex natural language data and training a model to capture these sentiment elements accurately. The project utilizes state-of-the-art transformer models for the sentiment analysis task. The goal is to create a robust system that can handle real-world text data and provide detailed sentiment analysis that can be valuable for various applications, such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research.

* Predicting Flight Delays with Enhanced Data Analysis
  
Commercial flight delays are not only frequent but also costly. Leveraging extensive flight data and weather insights, our team developed a cutting-edge prediction model to forecast U.S. domestic flight delays two hours prior to departure. By integrating multiple datasets, we trained and evaluated various predictive models. Our ensemble model, significantly outperformed the baseline, achieving an F2 score of 0.558 compared to the baseline's 0.091. Key to our success was integrating novel data features, showcasing the power of thorough data analysis.

* The Politics of Dating: How Political Affiliation Influences Match Rates
  
In an era where political polarization is palpable, this study delves into its influence on modern dating decisions. By integrating political labels - conservative, liberal, or neutral - into dating profiles on popular apps like Hinge and Tinder, we aimed to discern any impact on match rates. Focusing on Houston, Texas, our findings were enlightening: notably, women on Hinge saw a significant drop in match rates when their profiles leaned conservatively, but the broader influence across various platforms and genders remained inconclusive.

* Analyzing Voter Challenges in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election: A Study on Partisan Voting Difficulties
  
The 2020 US Presidential Election, was marked by an unprecedented voter turnout of approximately 160 million Americans. Against this backdrop, our study posed a crucial question: Which voter group, Democrat or Republican, faced more challenges in the 2020 voting process? Using data from the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES) Time Series Study, we discovered that Democrats reported more voting difficulties than their Republican counterparts. This insight provides valuable context to the current voting reforms and potential implications for future elections.
