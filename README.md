## Projects
### Unified model for Structured Sentiment Analysis.
Our project delivers in-depth sentiment insights from text by identifying not just the sentiment's tone, but also its "Source" (who expresses it), "Target" (subject of sentiment), "Polar_expression" (specific sentiment descriptors), and "Polarity" (overall sentiment value). Harnessing advanced transformer models, our aim is a comprehensive system adept at analyzing real-world textsâ€”ideal for applications like customer feedback, social media oversight, and market research.[Structured Sentiment Study](https://github.com/njrondon/w203_2020_election)

### Predicting Flight Delays with Enhanced Data Analysis
Commercial flight delays are not only frequent but also costly. Leveraging extensive flight data and weather insights, our team developed a cutting-edge prediction model to forecast U.S. domestic flight delays two hours prior to departure. Key to our success was integrating novel data features, showcasing the power of thorough data analysis.[Flight Delays](https://github.com/njrondon/w203_2020_election)

### The Politics of Dating: How Political Affiliation Influences Match Rates
In an era where political polarization is palpable, this study delves into its influence on modern dating decisions. By integrating political labels - conservative, liberal, or neutral - into dating profiles on popular apps like Hinge and Tinder, we aimed to discern any impact on match rates.

### Analyzing Voter Challenges in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election: A Study on Partisan Voting Difficulties 
The 2020 US Presidential Election, was marked by an unprecedented voter turnout of approximately 160 million Americans. Against this backdrop, our study posed a crucial question: Which voter group, Democrat or Republican, faced more challenges in the 2020 voting process? Using data from the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES), we discovered that Democrats reported more voting difficulties than their Republican counterparts. This insight provides valuable context to the current voting reforms and potential implications for future elections.[Voting Study](https://github.com/njrondon/w203_2020_election)
